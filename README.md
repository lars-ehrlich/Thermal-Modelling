# Thermal Modelling
Repository containing Thermal models used for energy harvesting and exploitation in glider flights. These implementations are very rudimentary and basic and not optimized for performance or applicability and should only serve as a starting point for further analysis and investigations.

## Implemented
The basic Idea of the Thermals
### Gaussian Thermals (2D)
### Gedeon Thermals (2D)
### AllenGedeonThermal (3D)

## Not (yet) Implemented
### True Allen Thermal (3D)
- as described in paper
### Bubble Thermal (3D)
- as described in 
### Ridge Lift
- not really thermals but could be interesting for testing

## Structure
The Thermal.py baseclase provides the interfaces for the implementation of the different thermals.

## Known Problems
